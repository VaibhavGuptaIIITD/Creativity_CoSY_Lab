**PROTEINS AND THEIR STRUCTURE**

Proteins composed structural and motor elements in the cell, and they serve as the catalysts for biochemical reactions. Each gene in cellular DNA contains the code for a unique protein structure. These proteins are assembled with different amino acid sequences, they are held together by different bonds and are folded into a variety of three-dimensional structures (folded shape, or conformation, depending directly on the linear amino acid sequence of the protein).

Amino Acids (a central carbon atom linked to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable component called a side chain) linked together by peptide bonds (long chain) make up the protein structure. Peptide bonds are formed by a biochemical reaction that extracts a water molecule as it joins the amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of a neighboring amino acid.

Proteins are built from a set of 20 amino acids, each having a unique side chain (non polar / positive charges / negative charges / polar but uncharged). These side chains can bond with one another to hold a length of protein in a certain shape or conformation (Charged amino acid side chains - ionic bonds, polar amino acids - hydrogen bonds, Hydrophobic side chains - Van der Waals interactions, noncovalent bonds). This series of interactions results in protein folding. 

Amino acid sequence drives folding and intramolecular bonding, determining its 3D shape. Also, Hydrogen bonding between amino groups and carboxyl groups in neighboring regions of the protein chain causes certain patterns of folding to occur. The final shape is the most energetically favorable one (during folding, they test a variety of conformations before reaching their final form, which is unique and compact). The folded proteins are stabilized by noncovalent bonds between amino acids, as well as chemical forces between a protein and its immediate environment.

**PROTEIN FOLDING PROBLEM**

Figuring out how proteins twist and fold into their final 3D shape :-
What makes proteins fold the way they do? Like what forces and rules govern this?
How does the folding actually happen step by step?
Can we look at a protein's building blocks (amino acids) and predict future shape?
Anfinsen’s Thermodynamic Hypothesis - Proteins fold into their final shape naturally, based only on their building blocks (amino acids) and their environment, irrespective of how it’s made, that is test tube proteins will fold the same way as a cell one. Also, protein folding follows the rule of chemistry. 

Hydrophobic Interaction, that is how parts of the protein's building blocks avoid water, was found to be one of the major reasons for protein folding. Proteins have water avoiding cores which are moved into oil-like environments taking up a certain amount of energy. So, Proteins unfold in oils and even when you mix up a protein's sequence, keeping only the pattern of water-loving and water-avoiding parts, it still folds correctly. Other important forces such as Hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces and Electrical charges also help determine the final shape after protein folding.

So how does this string know how to fold into exactly the right shape in just microseconds, when there are countless possible ways it could fold? The Funnel Concept is that, imagine you're on top of a mountain with a ball, and there's a valley below. No matter where you release the ball, it will eventually roll down to the bottom. Proteins work similarly, The unfolded protein starts at the top of the "energy funnel".Different molecules might take different paths down but they all end up in the same final shape at the bottom. This explains why proteins reliably fold into the same shape every time.

In proteins, small sections fold into simpler structures, then these small pieces combine into larger sections. Finally, the larger sections come together to make the final structure, and folding occurs after every combination. The complexity of the final shape largely determines the folding speed of the protein. 

Zipping and Assembly Method (ZAM) is used to predict protein structures. The protein chain is divided into small segments of 8 amino acids each which are simulated independently for sampling of possible conformations at different temperatures. Fragments that show stable structures are identified and are then extended by adding additional amino acids. New simulations are performed on these extended fragments and this process repeats till stable structures are formed. Stable fragments that could potentially interact are identified and are simulated together to see if they form stable interactions.

**ALPHAFOLD**

AlphaFold is a complex neural network that predicts 3D protein structures from amino acid sequences. It has two main stages:

1. Trunk stage- This stage processes the input data, including the amino acid sequence and aligned sequences of similar proteins (MSA). It uses repeated layers of a novel neural network block called Evoformer to produce two arrays: one representing the processed MSA and another representing residue pairs.

2. Structure module- This stage introduces an explicit 3D structure, using rotation and translation for each residue. It refines the structure through iterative refinement, using a novel equivariant transformer and a loss term that emphasizes orientational correctness.

Key innovations include:

- Evoformer blocks for exchanging information within MSA and pair representations
- Equivariant transformer for implicit reasoning about unrepresented side-chain atoms
- Iterative refinement through "recycling" of outputs
- Loss term emphasizing 

The Evoformer is a building block of the AlphaFold network that predicts protein structures. It views the prediction problem as a graph inference problem in 3D space.

1. MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) representation: Encodes information about individual residues and their sequences.
2. Pair representation: Encodes relationships between residues, such as distances and angles.

MSA updates pair representation through an element-wise outer product, enabling continuous communication between MSA and pair representations. 

The structure module takes the pair representation and the original sequence row (single representation) from the trunk and predicts the 3D backbone structure of the protein.

1. Residue Gas Representation is for the 3D backbone structure as Nres independent rotations and translations.
2. Invariant Point Attention (IPA) updates neural activations without changing 3D positions, using geometry-aware attention.
3. Equivariant Update Operation updates the residue gas representation using the updated activations.

Loss Function compares predicted atom positions to true positions under multiple alignments, using a clamped L1 loss. This encourages atoms to be correct relative to the local frame of each residue.

AlphaFold is initially trained on labelled data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The trained network predicts structures for 350,000 diverse sequences, creating a new dataset. The network is re-trained using both labelled PDB data and the new dataset.

**ADAPT MUZERO TO PROTEIN FOLDING **

1. Define the Problem as a Sequential Decision-Making Task

For MuZero to work, the protein folding process must be framed as a series of actions leading to a final state (the folded structure). Here’s how we could conceptualize it:
- States: Represent intermediate protein conformations during folding.
- Actions: Define actions as transformations or adjustments to the 3D positions of amino acid residues (e.g., rotating bonds, moving residues).
- Environment Dynamics: Model the physics-based changes that occur when an action is taken (e.g., the new conformation after an amino acid moves or rotates).
- Reward Function: Design a reward that guides MuZero toward the correct folded structure. For example:
- Use RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) to the target structure as a negative reward.
- Include energy minimization as a reward, aligning with principles of protein folding (e.g., lower energy = more stable structure).

2. Modify the Dynamics Model

MuZero’s dynamics model predicts future states based on actions. You would need to:
- Train the dynamics model to simulate how structural adjustments (actions) change the protein’s conformation.
- Use physical or empirical models (like force fields or machine-learned approximations) to guide how actions influence residue positions.

3. Incorporate Biological Priors

Unlike traditional applications of MuZero, protein folding requires domain-specific knowledge:
- MSA Features: Integrate evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments to inform the initial state or constrain the action space.
- Geometric Constraints: Ensure that generated structures respect basic physical and chemical constraints (e.g., bond lengths, angles, and steric clashes).
- Energy Functions: Include energy functions like Rosetta or molecular dynamics tools to evaluate the stability of generated structures.

4. Redesign the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Protein folding presents an enormous search space, so MCTS needs to be adapted:
- Efficient Sampling: Design heuristics to explore only biologically plausible conformations instead of random sampling.
- Pruning: Discard unrealistic conformations early in the search process.
- Parallelization: Leverage GPUs/TPUs to parallelize MCTS, as protein folding requires evaluating a vast number of potential structures.

5. Simplify the Action Space

The action space must be manageable:
- Represent actions as small movements (e.g., torsion angle adjustments or rigid-body transformations).
- Use coarse-grained models for faster computation, refining only at the end with all-atom models.

6. Train the Model

Training MuZero for protein folding would involve:
- Data: Use known protein structures from databases like PDB (Protein Data Bank).
- Training Loop: Simulate the folding process as MuZero “acts” to reach lower-energy conformations.
- Loss Functions: RMSD to the target structure, Energy minimization scores, Constraints to ensure realistic backbone and side-chain conformations.

7. Evaluate and Iterate

Evaluate how well the adapted MuZero folds proteins:-
- Test it on known structures and compare predictions to experimental results.
- Analyze how efficiently it explores the folding landscape (does it find correct structures quickly?).
- Refine the reward function, action space, and model architecture as needed.
