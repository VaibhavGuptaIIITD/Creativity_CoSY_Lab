# Ensemble Pipeline for Adaptive Streaming NLP with Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation

## Executive Summary
This proposal presents a comprehensive ensemble pipeline that combines seven state-of-the-art approaches to create a robust system for adaptive streaming NLP while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The pipeline integrates slang detection, continual learning, biological inspiration, and efficient streaming mechanisms to handle dynamic text streams with evolving language patterns.

## Core Architecture Overview
The ensemble operates as a multi-stage pipeline where each component addresses specific aspects of the streaming NLP challenge:

### Stage 1: Preprocessing & Slang Detection Layer  
**Components:** Pal & Saha (2013) + Pei et al. (2019) + SlangNet (2016)  
This layer performs dynamic vocabulary preprocessing to handle evolving language:

- **Primary Filter (Pal & Saha):** Uses the four-module hybrid pipeline for initial slang detection with supervised detection, sounds-alike matching, fuzzy sliding-window matching, and semi-supervised synset verification  
- **Deep Detection (Pei et al.):** BiLSTM-CRF model provides sentence-level slang detection and token-level identification with rich feature embeddings (POS shifts, PMI, bigram counts)  
- **Knowledge Base (SlangNet):** Serves as the structured lexicon for slang normalization and sense disambiguation  

**Integration Strategy:** The semi-supervised learning from Pal & Saha continuously enriches SlangNet, while Pei et al.'s deep model provides contextual validation. New slang detected by the deep model feeds back to update the rule-based filters.

### Stage 2: Biological-Inspired Sparse Encoding  
**Component:** Shen et al. (2023)  
Before main transformer processing, implement the fruit fly-inspired sparse coding layer:

- **Sparse Projection:** Dense text embeddings → random projection to ~40× dimension → Winner-Take-All thresholding → sparse activation pattern  
- **Interference Reduction:** The sparse coding reduces overlap between different linguistic patterns, making the downstream transformer more robust to interference  
- **Local Updates:** Prepare for associative learning in later stages

### Stage 3: Core Streaming Transformer with Memory  
**Component:** Main BTP Paper + StreamingLLM (2024)  
The central processing unit combines the memory-augmented transformer with efficient streaming:

- **Temporal Attention:** Implements the temporal decay mechanism (λ = 0.1) for emphasizing recent content while maintaining historical context  
- **Memory Buffer:** Maintains 10,000 representative samples using reservoir sampling and diversity-based selection  
- **Attention Sinks:** Incorporates StreamingLLM's attention sink mechanism, keeping 4 initial tokens as attention anchors plus sliding window cache  
- **Experience Replay:** Mixes current data with memory samples (γ = 0.3) during each update

### Stage 4: Continual Learning & Forgetting Prevention  
**Components:** EWC (2017) + UKD (2022)  
This layer provides dual protection against catastrophic forgetting:

- **Parameter Protection (EWC):** Applies Fisher Information Matrix-weighted constraints to preserve important parameters from previous tasks  
- **Knowledge Distillation (UKD):** Uses unlabeled streaming data to maintain knowledge of previous tasks through teacher-student distillation  
- **Adaptive Regularization:** Dynamically adjusts regularization strength based on distribution shift detection

### Stage 5: Associative Output Layer  
**Component:** Shen et al. (2023) - Associative Learning  
The final prediction layer uses biological principles:

- **Partial Freezing:** Only updates weights connected to the active prediction target, leaving other associations intact  
- **Local Learning:** Perceptron-like updates without global backpropagation through this layer  
- **Bounded Synapses:** Implements synaptic bounds to prevent runaway weight growth

## Detailed Integration Mechanisms

### 1. Cross-Component Communication  
- **Slang Feedback Loop:** New slang patterns detected by the deep learning components automatically update the rule-based filters and SlangNet database, creating a self-improving preprocessing layer.  
- **Memory Management:** The memory buffer from the core transformer is informed by:
  - Importance scores from EWC's Fisher Information Matrix  
  - Difficulty scores from associative learning layer  
  - Diversity metrics from sparse coding patterns  
- **Adaptive Thresholding:** All components use shared confidence thresholds that adapt based on:
  - Current forgetting coefficient (α_t) from the main architecture  
  - Distribution shift magnitude detected by the preprocessing layer  
  - Attention sink utilization from StreamingLLM

### 2. Multi-Scale Temporal Processing  
- **Short-term (StreamingLLM):** Handles immediate context through attention sinks and sliding windows  
- **Medium-term (Memory Buffer):** Maintains representative samples across recent time periods  
- **Long-term (EWC + SlangNet):** Preserves stable linguistic knowledge and established slang patterns

### 3. Robustness Mechanisms  
- **Redundant Detection:** Multiple slang detection methods provide robustness against evolving obfuscation techniques  
- **Multiple Forgetting Defenses:** EWC, UKD, memory replay, and associative learning provide layered protection  
- **Graceful Degradation:** If any component fails, others can compensate (e.g., if memory buffer is corrupted, EWC still protects parameters)

## System Flow

1. **Input Stream Processing:** Raw text enters through slang detection pipeline  
2. **Normalization:** Detected slang normalized using SlangNet  
3. **Sparse Encoding:** Text converted to sparse representations  
4. **Transformer Processing:** Core transformer with temporal attention and memory  
5. **Continual Learning:** EWC and UKD apply forgetting prevention  
6. **Associative Prediction:** Final layer produces outputs with local learning  
7. **Feedback:** Results inform memory management and slang database updates
